  Come o-ve-r to the win-dow, my lit-tle dar - ling,
  
  7   7    7  7   -6 7    -6   6
  I'd like to try to read your palm

  I used to think I was some - kind of gyp-sy boy

  to laugh and cry and cry and laugh a  -  bout it all a-  gain
  
  
  
  
  
  Well, you know that I love to live with you,
  But you make me forget so very much
  I forget to pray for the angel
  And then the angels forget to pray for us
  
  
  Chorus
  
  We met when we were almost young
  Deep in the green lilac park
  You held on to me like I was a crucifix
  As we went kneeling through the dark
  
  Chorus
  
  Your letters say that you are beside me now
  Then why do I feel alone?
  I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web
  Is fastening my ankle to a stone
  
  Chorus
  
  For now I need your hidden love
  I'm cold as a new razor blade
  You left when I told you I was curious
  I never said that I was brave
  
  Chorus
  
  O you are really such a pretty one
  I see you've gone and changed your name again
  And just when I climbed this whole mountainside
  To wash my eyelids in the rain
  
  Chorus


HALLELUJA 
   5    6     6     6  6 -6 -6   -6 
  I've heard there was a secret chord 
   5    6 6    6      6  6    -6    -6   -6 
  That David played, and it pleased the Lord 
   6  -6   -6   -6 -6   -6   6  6  -5  6   6 
  But you don't really care for music, do you? 
  5   6    6    6     6   -6     -6   -7 
  It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth 
  6    7     7    -6   7 7   -8 
  The minor fall, the major lift 
  7   -8  -8   -8     8   8    8 -8 -8 7  7 
  The baffled king composing Hal-le-lu---jah 
  
   5  6  -6 -6   -6  6  5   5 
  Hal-le-lu-jah, Hal-le-lu-jah, 
   5  6  -6 -6   -6  6  5 -5 5 -4 4 -3 4 
  Hal-le-lu-jah, Hal-le-lu------------jah 
  
   5    6     6     6   6   6   -6 -6   -6 
  Your faith was strong but you needed proof 
   5   6   6   6  6   -6 -6   -6 
  You saw her bathing on the roof 
   6  -6 -6  -6  -6  -6   6    6 -5  6     6 
  Her beauty and the moonlight over-threw you 
   5   6    6  6  6 -6  -6   -7 
  She tied you to a kitchen chair 
   6   7     7     7     -6   7   7    -8 
  She broke your throne, she cut your hair 
   7   -8  -8   -8   -8   8    8   8  -8 -8 7  7 
  And from your lips she drew the Hal-le-lu---jah 
  
  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, 
  Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
  
  6  6  6  6    6    -6  -6 -6 
  Maybe I have been here before 
  5  6    6    6    6    -6     -6   -6 
  I know this room, I've walked this floor 
  6  -6  -6  -6  -6 -6  6  6  -5  6    6 
  I used to live alone before I  knew you 
   5    6    6    6   6   6  -6 -6  -7 
  I've seen your flag on the marble arch 
   7   7   7 -6  7  7   -8 
  Love is not a victory march 
   7   7 -8   -8  -8  -8  8  8   8  -8 -8 7  7 
  It's a cold and it's a broken Hal-le-lu---jah 
  
  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, 
  Hallelujah, Hallelujah

SOUND OF SILENCE 
   -4 -4  -5  -5  -6 -6    6
   Hello darkness my old friend
    4    4   4   5    5    6  6 -5
   I've come to talk with you again
   -5 -5  -5 -6 -6   7  7   -8   7
   Because a vision softly creeping
    -5  -5   -6    -6   7  7   -8  7
   Left its seeds while I was sleeping
   -5  -5  -8 -8   -8   8   -9 -9  8  -8   7
   And the vision that was planted in my brain
    -8    7 -6
   Still remains
   -5 -5  -5    7   5  -5 -4
   Within the sound of silence
   
   -4  -4 -4     -5  -5  -6   -6 6
   In restless dreams I walked alone
    4  4     5    5   6  6  -5
   Narrow streets of cobblestone
     -5   -5 -6 -6 7  7   -8    7
   'Neath the halo of a street lamp
   -5  -5   -5 -6 -6  7   7   -8  -8   7
   I turned my collar to the cold and damp
    -5  -5  -8   -8    -8    -8  8   -9  -9 -9 8 -8   7
   When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
    7    -8    7   -6
   That split the night
   -5    -5    -5    7   5  -5 -4
   And touched the sound of silence
   
   -4  -4 -4  -5 -5  -6  -6  6
   And in the naked light I saw
    4    4  4    5  5  6  6  -5
   Ten thousand people maybe more
   -5 -5  -6  -6   7  7    -8   7
   People talking without speaking
   -5 -5  -6  -6   7  7   -8 -8  7
   People hearing without listening
   -5 -5   -8 -8   -8    8   -9 -9  8 -8    7
   People writing songs that voices never share
    7  -8  7   -6
   And no one dare
   -5 -5   -5    7   5  -5 -4
   Disturb the sound of silence
   
     -4     -4 -5  -5  -6 -6   6
   "Fools" said I "You do not know
    4  4    5   5  6  6   -5
   Silence like a cancer grow
    -5  -5  -6    -6  7   7    -8    7
   Hear my words that I might teach you
    -5  -5  -6   -6  7   7    -8    7
   Take my arms that I might reach you"
   -5  -5  -8    8   -9 -9   8   -8    7
   But my words like silent raindrops fell
    5  -5 -5
   And echoed
   -5 -5    7   5  -5  -4
   In the wells of silence
   
   -4  -4  -5 -5   -6   -6    6
   And the people bowed and prayed
   4   4  5 5   6   6    -5
   To the neon god they made
   -5  -5   -6    -6     7   7   -8  7 
   And the sign flashed out its warning
   -5 -5   -6    -6  7   7   -8  7
   In the words that it was forming
   -5  -5   -6   7     7   -8   -8 -8   -8 -8      
   And the sign said "The words of the prophets  
    8  -9 -9   -9 -9   8 -8   7
   are written on the subway walls
    7 -8 -8  7   -6
   And tenement halls
    5    -5 -5   -5 -5     7   5  -5 -4
   And whisper'd in the sounds of silence

  Yes, 'n' how many years can some people exist
  Before they're allowed to be free?
  Yes, 'n' how many times can a man turn his head,
  Pretending he just doesn't see?
  The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,
  The answer is blowin' in the wind.
  
  How many times must a man look up
  Before he can see the sky?
  Yes, 'n' how many ears must one man have
  Before he can hear people cry?
  Yes, 'n' how many deaths will it take till he knows
  That too many people have died?
  The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,
  The answer is blowin' in the wind.

CHANT DES PARTISANTS
   6 7 7 -8 8 8 -8 7 7 -7 -6 6 -7 -6 6
   Ami, entends-tu le vol noir des corbeaux sur nos plaines ?
   6 7 7 -8 8 8 -8 7 7 -7 -6 6 -7 -6 6
   Ami, entends-tu les cris sourds du pays qu'on enchaîne ?
   6 8 8 -9 9 9 -9 8 -8 8 -9 7 -7 -8 -6 6
   Ohé, partisans, ouvriers et paysans, c'est l'alarme.
   6 8 8 -9 9 9 -9 8 -8 8 -9 7 -7 -8 -6 6
   Ce soir l'ennemi connaîtra le prix du sang et les larmes.
   
   Montez de la mine, descendez des collines, camarades !
   Sortez de la paille les fusils, la mitraille, les grenades.
   Ohé, les tueurs à la balle et au couteau, tuez vite !
   Ohé, saboteur, attention à ton fardeau : dynamite...
   
   C'est nous qui brisons les barreaux des prisons pour nos frères.
   La haine à nos trousses et la faim qui nous pousse, la misère.
   Il y a des pays où les gens au creux des lits font des rêves.
   Ici, nous, vois-tu, nous on marche et nous on tue, nous on crève...
   
   Ici chacun sait ce qu'il veut, ce qu'il fait quand il passe.
   Ami, si tu tombes un ami sort de l'ombre à ta place.
   Demain du sang noir sèchera au grand soleil sur les routes.
   Chantez, compagnons, dans la nuit la Liberté nous écoute...
   
   Ami, entends-tu ces cris sourds du pays qu'on enchaîne ?
   Ami, entends-tu le vol noir des corbeaux sur nos plaines ?
   Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh...
