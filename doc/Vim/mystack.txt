TIPS 
		  gUgU or gUU # duplicate operator on whole line

		  >G   # increase indentation until the end of file
		  s		cl  # change one char
		  S    ^C
		  C    c$

		  f+s + <Esc>;.;.;.  # remplace "+" par " + "
		  note : capital letters and some chars are much rarer. sport them
		  180<C-a>kkk.  # add 180 to all 
		  :h operator
		  :h :map-operator
			:h omap-info

		  INsret 
		  <c-h>  delete oback cahr 
		  <c-w>  word 
		  <c-u>  line or jsut inserted
		  ga # show the hewa code for char 
		  <c-k>cahr1 char2 insert unicode by digraph
		  R # get in pelace made and stay in replace mode 
		  80a-<esc>

		you donâ€™t, you probably want to add the following line to your vimrc:
		set nrformats=
		This will cause Vim to treat all numerals as decimal, regardless of whether they are
		padded with zeros.

			Moving Around in Insert Mode Resets the Change
